# Quiz

## Description
    This was a fun project to do but it was a bit stressful, I did go at it a wrong way trying to create everything in the javascript when I couldve created alot of it in the HTML and take all the elements from there to the javascript but even doing so it made it challenging but fun going through.

## Usage
    This will help you further your knowledge on what you know about javascript by taking this short quiz and seeing what score you can get and the previous highscores you may have gotten as well.
